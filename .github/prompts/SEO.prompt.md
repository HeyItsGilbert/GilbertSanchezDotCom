I need an SEO performance review for my Hugo blog at https://gilbertsanchez.com.

**Context:**
I implemented a comprehensive SEO optimization plan approximately [X weeks/months] ago with the following changes:

**Phase 1 & 2 (Reduce Bounce Rate + Improve CTR):**
- Enabled related content display (up to 6 posts)
- Added strategic internal links between top 5 posts
- Optimized meta titles and descriptions for search terms:
  - "wezterm config" → "WezTerm Config Guide: Complete Setup with Examples (2024)"
  - "starship transient prompt" → included in title
  - "obsidian for adhd" → "How to Use Obsidian for ADHD"
- Updated lastmod timestamps on top posts

**Phase 3 (Technical SEO):**
- Added keywords to all 28 posts (100% coverage)
- Included taxonomy/term pages in sitemap
- Created custom robots.txt (allows Anthropic, blocks OpenAI/Google-Extended)
- Set up search console verification fields

**Baseline Metrics (before optimization):**
- Monthly visitors: 931
- Bounce rate: 89%
- Pages/session: 1.3
- Search CTR: 1.86% (top query)
- Top 5 posts: 91% of traffic

**Target Metrics:**
- Bounce rate: 75% (16% reduction)
- Search CTR: 3.5% (88% increase)
- Pages/session: 1.8 (38% increase)
- Monthly visitors: 1,200+ (29% growth)

**Review Request:**
1. Compare current analytics to baseline - what improved, what didn't?
2. Analyze Google Search Console data (queries, CTR, impressions, positions)
3. Check Bing Webmaster Tools performance (31% of traffic comes from Bing!)
4. Review sitemap indexing status
5. Identify underperforming posts with optimization potential
6. Recommend next optimization steps based on actual performance data

Please analyze the results and provide actionable recommendations.
