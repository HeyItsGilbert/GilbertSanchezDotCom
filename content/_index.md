summary: Gilbert's blog covering everything from ANSI to zsh!
---
I've created this blog as a way to help share some of my discoveries. I'm a
believer in Learning in Public and nothing I write is "The Way" but rather "A
Way".

I work as a (Se√±or) Systems Engineer at Meta, spreading the love of
PowerShell at scale. A fan of Role Playing Games (RPG), you can check out my
RPG-oriented modules on the PowerShell Gallery.
