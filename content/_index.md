I've created this blog as a way to help share some of my discoveries. I'm a
believer in Learning in Public and these posts are more polished compared 
to the notes in my [Digital Garden](https://garden.gilbertsanchez.com/).

Nothing I write is "The Way" but rather "A Way". Have a different approach?
Tell me all about it!

I work as a Staff Software Development Engineer, formerly known as
the Señor Systems Engineer at Meta. I enjoy spreading the love of
PowerShell at scale. A fan of Role Playing Games (RPG), you can check out my
RPG-oriented modules on the PowerShell Gallery.
