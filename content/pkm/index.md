# Notes

Hi all, welcome to my [DigitalGarden]({{< relref "DigitalGarden" >}}). I've been taking a lot of notes in [atomics/Obsidian]({{< relref "atomics/Obsidian" >}}) and I came across some Digital Garden's. I love the idea of learning in Public, so I decided to give it a go.

I'm going to document how I built this site with [atomics/Obsidian]({{< relref "atomics/Obsidian" >}}), [atomics/PowerShell]({{< relref "atomics/PowerShell" >}}) and [Hugo]({{< relref "Hugo" >}}).
