Slides, images, and code from my presentations. This is a work in progress while
I slowly go back and add some of my historical works.

Presentations are written in [Marp](https://marp.app/). This site is generated
by Hugo, so I allow Hugo to render the markdown, but I also include a
presentation page, PDF, and PPTX in the same URI. I will link those at the top.
