I realized I didn't have anything linking to my previous talk at Chocolatey Fest
back in 2018. This was also the time I accidentally started my speaker timer 10
minutes early. See if you can notice the panic when I realize I'm 10m behind 
where I'm supposed to be (but wasn't actually) :sob:

Talk summary

I'm still looking into releasing our maintenance cookbook but a lot of the core
business logic needs to be pulled out.
