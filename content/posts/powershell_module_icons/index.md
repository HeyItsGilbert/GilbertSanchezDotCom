Last month I saw Adam Bacon talking about updating his modules and I noticed how
he had icons for each. In my high school days I had planned on being a graphic
designer (before I was talked out of it).

All of my modules are based on Stucco 
([https://github.com/devblackops/Stucco](https://github.com/devblackops/Stucco))
and published on github. That luckily made the change pretty easy.

1. Make a list of my modules
2. Find an appropriate Creative Commons icon
3. Upload the image to Github
4. Update the PowerShell Module Metadata file (PSD1) to point to the new image.
