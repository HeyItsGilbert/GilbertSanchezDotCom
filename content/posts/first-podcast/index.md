Back on June 3rd I was invited to be a guest speaker for the PowerShell Podcast.
It was an absolute blast, and even though I was nervous Andrew and Jordan were
super fun to talk to. Take a listen and let me know what you think.

P.S. Looks like Andrew and Jordan will be having me at their user groups, so
stayed tuned for that.
