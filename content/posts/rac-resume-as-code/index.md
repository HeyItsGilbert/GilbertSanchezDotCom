A few months ago I was applying for a new role and I was able to give my
LinkedIn profile (which was mostly up to date). The recruiter replied later and
said that the team was interested in meeting and..

> "Can you send me a copy of your resume?"

See the last time I worked on my resume it was on...  Apple
Pages :man_facepalming:. Which was a problem since I hadn't owned a Mac in almost a decade.

Maybe you wrote yours in Word, and now you don't have access to Word. Or maybe
it renders strangely in the new version. Have you edited it lately? Having to
deal with things like messing with weird tables and odd formatting. The bullet
points are different font sizes and it just looks sloppy.

So how do you avoid this ecosystem lock in? Use JSON!

By the end of this you'll learn about JSON Resume:

1. Learn how to use the JSON Resume schema.
2. See and configure the different hosting options.
3. Style your resume by exploring the different themes.
4. Be able to quickly create your resume on Netlify.

Want the tl;dr?

1. Clone my [resume repository](https://github.com/HeyItsGilbert/resume)
2. Update the `resume.json` with your info.
3. Setup netlify to build your new clone with `yarn build`.

## JSON Resume to the Rescue

> JSON Resume is a community driven open source initiative to create JSON-based standard for resumes. - <https://jsonresume.org/>

JSON Resume is a FOSS project that allows you to codify the data of your resume
into JSON. It offers a simple schema to easy add/remove/update your resume over
time.

You can see an example of complete resume at on the
[Schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema) page.

The one thing i would suggest is adding the schema to top of your JSON:

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/v1.0.0/schema.json",
}
```

If your editor supports it, which VS Code does, you'll now get IntelliSense support for adding info.

## Install It

Once you have your resume json ready you can start to build it with `resumed` which is an NPM package.

{{< alert >}}
If you haven't used Node or npm, I would suggest reading one of the many guides on installing it and configuring it.
{{< /alert >}}

You will need to install it and find and install the theme you want. To see all
the possible themes check out this
[jsonresume-theme search](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=jsonresume-theme). I personally like the `jsonresume-theme-elegant` theme.

```shell
npm install resumed jsonresume-theme-elegant
```

## Build It

Once it's installed you'll want to build your resume with the command: `resumed render`. This should create a `resume.html` page!

Rinse and repeat as you make changes.

## Serve It

Once you've built your resume html you now need to service it over the web. You
have a few options to do that.

1. Post your `resume.json` as a gist and it'll automatically show up.
2. OR Use a static site hosting service where you can build your resume, just like you just did.
3. OR Do both!

### Gist

The gist is the easiest way to share your resume.

1. Go to <https://gist.github.com/>
2. Create a new gist called `resume.json`
3. Paste in your json.
4. You can then go to [registry.jsonresume.org/heyitsgilbert](https://registry.jsonresume.org/thomasdavis) where you replace `heyitsgilbert` with your github username.

### Netlify

This is my preferred way because it allows me to easily build my static content and serve it under my personal resume.

1. Make a GitHub repository to host your resume, and few other files.
   1. You can make this easy by cloning my
      [resume repository](https://github.com/HeyItsGilbert/resume) and updating
      the `resume.json`
2. Create an account or sign in on Netlify.
3. Grant access to your new resume repository.
4. Then you have to configure your build.

Quick note about my repository. I have a public folder with a `.gitkeep` file in
it so the directory always exists. In my `packages.json` build step I copy the `resume.html` to
`public\index.html`.

On Netlify you typically have to tell it what your build steps. Since the `packages.json` file has my build step defined, I tell it use that via `yarn build`.

Here are my "Build Settings"

- Runtime: Not set
- Base directory: /
- Package directory: Not set
- Build command: `yarn build`
- Publish directory: public
- Functions directory: netlify/functions

So the only real "magic" is telling it to run the build step.

### Both

To do both you can just take your JSON from your repository and upload it to your gist every time it updates.

For GitHub you can use a github workflow with an action like `exuanbo/actions-deploy-gist`. You can see an example of how I do it at [gist.yml](https://github.com/HeyItsGilbert/resume/blob/main/.github/workflows/gist.yml). Note that your gist id will be unique.

## Tips

1. `resumed` outputs `resume.html`, but you can rename it to whatever you want.
2. Make your "live" version long, and tweak your JSON to generate role specific
   resumes.
   - AI is excellent at transforming structured data like JSON!
3. Find a theme that prints well so you can easily print to PDF.

This was a quick one I put together. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions/suggestions!
